We are gathered here today
To bear whitness to a demonstration
Of the Pet Dæmon prototype
That we have built persuant to
Our grant from Consensus
In collaboration with the new MetaMask OCap Kernel team

To fill a gap in the privacy and security properties of modern
    Operating systems
    Web applications
    Particularly Dapps
    And Smart Wallets
Borrowing technology and ideas from all of these
And synthesizing a new platform from existing
    The existing web platform
    And the Agoric platform.
The pet dæmon is a user agent like a web browser but for web applications.

Conventional web pages
    including dapps
give the publisher of that application
    an irrevocable connection that enables them
    to monitor or surveil all interaction with that application
    to the extent that the publisher desires.
This robs the user of agency and privacy,
    and limits the degree to which a responsible user
    can cautiously interact with that application.
We can do better.

The pet daemon aspires to solve these problems, and
with the assistance of your imagination,
I hope to convince you that the solution creates
opportunities for Agoric, MetaMask, and Moddable.

The pet daemon allows a user to install and distribute
applications and run them in a sandbox, confined to a sort of jail,
where they must appeal to the user for any powerful capabilities.
And, as hinted by the name, allows the user to manage those capabilities
with private, self-assigned names (pet names).

For Agoric, this would allow us to create a private alternative to our on-chain Smart Wallet.
Specifically, this would allow users to keep the names they have chosen for their assets to themselves.

For MetaMask, this creates an opportunity to make Snaps composable.
That is, an application can consume and produce APIs and allow them to…snap together.

This also creates opportunities for orchestration.

For Moddable, such a platform would provide an place to stand to privately
command and control IoT devices.
